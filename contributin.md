    1. Use relative paths. Your filesystem is different from someone else's.
    2. Remove redundant empty lines from the files.
    3. If you are commenting a part of code that involves logic (not something like a simple print statement), then please explain why you commented it out and under which circumstances does the user need to use that block by un-commenting it.
    4. Add reference comments/formulae to the code where some complex mathematical operation is involved. If you are not sure, then add references to the original source or some document where someone can read that up.
